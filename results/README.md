## Results:

This directory is created to store the results of this project.

If you run the pipeline, you will see the creation or the update of a log file in `logs/`.

You can further check the histograms that have been created with the testset.

### For the application of the full pipeline:

If you apply the full pipeline of this practical lab the folders `unfound_entries`, `unclear_entries`, `found_entries` are getting filled.

The command:
```bash
esc update
```
will update all created entries to the Wikdata database using the Integrator.

For cases that need manual checking, you have to evaluate youself using a GUI.
