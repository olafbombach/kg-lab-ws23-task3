This repository embodies an approach of identifying event series for scientific events such as conferences and workshops. The unstructured event data is queried from [dblp](https://dblp.org/) and assigned to the correct event series using the code provided here. After correctly assigning the event series, the property of event series is added to the KG of Wikidata.
