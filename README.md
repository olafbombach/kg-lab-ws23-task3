Knowledge Graph Lab üí° - winter semester 2023 - task 3

<img src="images/RWTH_Logo.png" width="500">

This repository embodies an approach of identifying event series for scientific events such as conferences and workshops. The unstructured event data is queried from [dblp](https://dblp.org/) and assigned to the correct event series using the code provided here. After correctly assigning the event series, the property of event series is added to the KG of Wikidata.

## Use Case Scenario
Situation:

The proceedings of the publication service CEUR-WS (CEUR Workshop Proceedings) already have entries in Wikidata, but the relation between individual proceedings is insufficient specified or missing.

Action:
<ul>
<li>Collect missing information from dblp and ceur-spt.
<li>Identify event series using Large Language Models.
<li>Validate the resulting event series.
<li>Update the Knowledge Graph.
</ul>

Expected Result:

Proceedings of the same event series are interconnected in a way such that the user is able to access the whole event series.
## Current status of the project:
<ul> 
    <li> Assessment of current KG status ‚ùå </li>
    <li> Preprocessing of queries ‚ùå </li>
    <il> (Method for encoding established) ‚ùå </il>
    <li> Validation of LLM (check for accuracy and precision) ‚ùå </li>
    <li> (Further methods of assignments established) ‚ùå </li>
    <li> Method for data transfer to the KG ‚ùå </li>
    <li> Establishment of an automated method ‚ùå </li>
    <li> Validation of the method ‚ùå </li>
</ul>
